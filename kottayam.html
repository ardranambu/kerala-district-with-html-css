    Kottayam, located in the heart of Kerala, is known for its rich cultural heritage, vibrant literary tradition, and scenic beauty. Often called the "Land of Letters, Latex, and Lakes," it is renowned for being the first town in India to achieve 100% literacy. Kottayam is a major hub for rubber plantations, contributing significantly to the state's economy. The region is dotted with serene backwaters and lush green landscapes, offering picturesque views and tranquil experiences, especially around Vembanad Lake. It is also a prominent center for publishing and printing, housing some of Kerala's oldest newspapers and publishing houses. With its blend of education, nature, and tradition, Kottayam holds a unique place in Kerala’s cultural and economic fabric.
