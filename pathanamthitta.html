Pathanamthitta, located in the southern part of Kerala, is known as the *spiritual
 heartland* of the state. It is home to the world-famous **Sabarimala Temple**, one of
  the largest annual pilgrimages in the world, attracting millions of devotees each year.
   The district is rich in natural beauty, with lush forests, rivers, and serene landscapes,
    making it a gateway to the Western Ghats. Pathanamthitta is also known for its vibrant festivals, 
    especially the **Maramon Convention**, one of the largest Christian gatherings in Asia. With a strong
     emphasis on tradition, religious harmony, and ecological beauty, Pathanamthitta offers a unique blend 
     of spirituality, culture, and nature.
